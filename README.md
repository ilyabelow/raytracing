# Raytracing

Simple raytracer that I've written as an exercise in C++ and geometry using only my brain and C++ standard library

## The raytracer supports:

* Planes, spheres and cylinders



* Coordinate system for each surface type which enables to make any shape

_(it's a water lily)_

* Reflection, refraction and translucency

* Textures
* Rendering to files

## TODO:

* **Light!** lighting is literally the coolest thing about raytracing
* **Quaternions!** because `Direction` abstraction sucks
* **Custom textures!** for that I'll have to read image files w/ external library
* **Concurrency!** so it runs fast
* **Drawing to a screen!** because opening files in not cool
* **Anti-Aliasing!** so distant textures are not as noisy
* **More demos!** and bug fixes
